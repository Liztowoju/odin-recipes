    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Coconut rice is a dish prepared by soaking white rice in coconut milk or cooking it with coconut flakes.[1] As both the coconut and the rice-plant are commonly found in the tropics all-around the world, coconut rice too is found in many cultures throughout the world, spanning across the equator from the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, South America, Central America, East Africa, West Africa, the Caribbean and Oceania.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Measure 4 cups (measuring cup) of rice and wash with cold water until water runs clear.
        </li>

        <li>Place large saucepan/pot over medium-high heat. Add the washed rice and cover with water and parboil for about 10 minutes. Dice up the turkey, boil with knorr, salt, and any season of your choice. You can use as is, fry or bake it slightly. I baked it slightly.</li>

        <li>After 10 minutes, drain and rinse the rice with cold water to stop the cooking process. </li>

        <li>Place the clean shrimp (deveined) you can peel off or leave the peel on. Season with seasoning powder/cubes, and salt. Combine and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place a large saucepan/pot over medium-high heat and add the oil. Add thyme, ginger, and stir, let the thyme release its fragrant. Add the sliced onion and combine.
        </li>
        <li>Add the shrimps and cook on both sides for one minute (don't worry you will cook it further). Remove the shrimps and set them aside.</li>
        <li>Add the coconut milk and the broth(or water) and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add the parboiled rice and mix. Add bay leaf and season with garlic powder, knorr, and salt. Cover and cook for about 8 minutes, the rice will be cooked but still firm by now.</li>
        <li>Add the turkey and combine.</li>
        <li>Add the vegetables and stir.</li>
        <li>Add the shrimps and combine thoroughly. Check for the season and adjust if necessary.  Continue to cook, but if you think the rice is not cooked to your satisfaction don't be tempted to add any liquid, just cover tightly, what you need is the steam.</li>
        <li>Cook further until the rice to your preference.  It is okay if it burns a little bit, it will give the rice the coconut aromatic flavor you want.</li>
        <li>Coconut rice with shrimps is ready! Enjoy!</li>
